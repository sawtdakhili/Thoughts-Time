WHAT IS AGPL-3.0?
==================

The GNU Affero General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software and other kinds of works,
specifically designed to ensure cooperation with the community in the case of network server software.

   - Provide a link to the original project: https://github.com/sawtdakhili/Thoughts-Time
   - Retain all copyright notices

2. **Share Source Code**:
   - If you modify this software and run it as a network service (web app, API, etc.)
   - You MUST provide the complete source code to users who interact with it
   - The source code must be easily accessible (e.g., GitHub repo link in the UI)

3. **Use Same License**:

NETWORK USE = DISTRIBUTION
===========================

The key feature of AGPL-3.0 is the "network use" clause:

If you run a modified version of this software on a server and let others interact with it
over a network (like a web application), you must provide them with access to the source code.

This prevents proprietary cloud services from taking the code without contributing back.
